# odin-recipes
This project will revolve around creating a basic structured website containing food recipes.
I will be demonstrating what I've learned so far in The Odin Project.

Everything will be written with very basic HTML.

It will contain the following:
- relative links
- relative images
- lists, both unordered and ordered
- paragraphs
- headings

I think that's about it for now.

Will update.
